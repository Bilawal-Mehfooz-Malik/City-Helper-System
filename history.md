## Chat History - Auth Flow and Location Handling Refinements

This session focused on fixing bugs and improving the user experience of the authentication flow, particularly the profile screen and location picking.

### 1. Profile Screen Name Field Bug Fix

-   **Goal**: Fix a bug where the user could not edit their name in the profile screen's name field.
-   **Implementation**: 
    -   Initially, the issue was thought to be with how the `TextEditingController` was being updated, but the root cause was the `onchanged` callback triggering a rebuild on every keystroke.
    -   The fix involved removing the `onchanged` callback and using a `ValueListenableBuilder` to only update the save button's state when the text changed.

### 2. Advanced Location Handling for Profile Screen

-   **Goal**: Implement a more robust location handling system for the profile screen.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Created a new `ProfileLocationController` to manage the complex logic of fetching and saving the user's location.
    -   **Fetching Logic**: The location is now fetched with the following priority:
        1.  Firestore (user's profile)
        2.  Shared Preferences
        3.  Default Location
    -   **Saving Logic**: When the user saves their profile, the location is saved to both Firestore and shared preferences.

### 3. Pick Location Screen Enhancements

-   **Goal**: Improve the user experience of the `PickLocationScreen`.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   The map now centers on the previously selected location when opened.
    -   The location preview on the previous screen (Profile or Get Started) now updates in real-time as the user pans the map. This was achieved by updating the controlling provider's state with a debounce timer in the `onCameraMove` callback.

### 4. Get Started Screen Location Flow

-   **Goal**: Refine the location handling in the "Get Started" screen flow.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   The initial location is now always the default location, and not fetched from shared preferences.
    -   The picked location is now remembered during the "Get Started" flow. If the user picks a location, closes the map, and re-opens it, the map will be centered on the last picked location.

## Chat History - Home Screen & Home Detail UI Refinements

This session focused on addressing various UI and display issues on the home screen and home detail screen, including filtering, popular indicators, pricing, and dynamic open/closed status.

### 1. Popular Entities Filtering Debugging

-   **Goal**: Investigate why popular entities were appearing in normal entity lists.
-   **Investigation**: Examined `EntitiesNotifier`, `PopularEntitiesNotifier`, `EntityService`, `FakeResidenceRepository`, `FakeFoodRepository`, `test_residences.dart`, and `test_food_list.dart`.
-   **Conclusion**: Determined that the filtering logic and test data were correct, and the issue was a misunderstanding.

### 2. Popular Indicator Refinement

-   **Goal**: Improve the visual display of the "popular" status on the home detail screen.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Changed the "popular" indicator from a star icon to a flame icon (`Icons.local_fire_department`).
    -   Implemented the flame icon next to the entity's name in both the `AppBar` (`AppBarContent`) and the `HomeDetailTopRightSection` (`ItemTitleSection`).

### 3. Pricing Display Confirmation

-   **Goal**: Confirm the correct display of pricing information on the home detail screen.
-   **Confirmation**: Verified that the `formattedPrice` and `displayLabel` were correctly combined and displayed, and confirmed with the user that the "Starts from" text was not desired.

### 4. Dynamic Open/Closed Status Display

-   **Goal**: Implement a more dynamic and context-aware display for entity open/closed status.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Modified `OpeningHoursWidget` to dynamically calculate `isOpen` based on `entity.entityStatus` and `OpeningHoursChecker.isOpenNow`.
    -   Refactored `OpeningHoursLabel` to receive the `EntityDetail` object.
    -   Implemented dynamic text for open/closed status in `OpeningHoursLabel`:
        -   For `Food`: "Open" / "Closed" (for both explicit and calculated status).
        -   For `Residence`: "Office Open" / "Office Closed" (for both explicit and calculated status).
    -   Added new localization keys (`officeOpen`, `officeClosed`) to `app/lib/src/localization/app_en.arb`.

### 5. Home Detail Right Section Redesign Attempt

-   **Goal**: Redesign the right section of the home detail screen for a more modern, professional, and user-friendly look.
-   **Attempted Implementation**: Proposed and implemented a refactoring using `Card`s for grouping and new custom widgets (`_PriceAndLocationSection`, `_RatingAndReviewSection`, `_ResidenceSpecificsSection`, `_OpeningHoursSection`, `_ContactOptionsSection`).
-   **Outcome**: The user was dissatisfied with the result and reverted the changes, preferring their own previous design.

## Chat History - Menu Images & Fullscreen Photo Viewer Enhancements

This session focused on enhancing the `HomeDetailScreen` with a new "Menu Images" section for food entities and refining the `FullscreenPhotoViewer`.

### 1. Dynamic Open/Closed Status Display Refinement

-   **Goal**: Hide the opening hours section and its divider if opening hours are null.
-   **Implementation**: Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_top_right_section.dart` to conditionally render `OpeningHoursWidget` and its associated `Divider` based on `entity.openingHours` being null.
This also fixed an inconsistency where non-residence entities lacked a divider.

### 2. Menu Images Section Implementation

-   **Goal**: Add a new section to display menu images for food entities on the `HomeDetailScreen`.
-   **Design Decisions**:
    -   **Placement**: Decided on a full-width section below the main details (`ResponsiveTwoColumnLayout`) and above the reviews (`HomeDetailBottomSection`).
    -   **Aspect Ratio**: Settled on a 3:4 portrait aspect ratio for menu image thumbnails, based on user feedback.
    -   **Height**: Set the horizontal list height to 240px.
    -   **Widget**: Used `ListView.separated` with `CustomImageWrapper` for skeleton loading and better image handling.
-   **Implementation Steps**:
    -   Confirmed `FoodDetail` already had `menuImageUrls`.
    -   Added placeholder `menuImageUrls` to `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/data/fake/test_food_details.dart`.
    -   Created `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/menu_section.dart`.
    -   Added "menu" localization key to `app/lib/src/localization/app_en.arb`.
    -   Integrated `MenuSection` into `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_bottom_section.dart`, conditionally showing it for `FoodDetail` with images.

### 3. Fullscreen Photo Viewer Enhancements & Bug Fixes

-   **Goal**: Improve the `FullscreenPhotoViewer`'s functionality and address UI issues.
-   **Bug Fix (Asset vs. Network Image)**:
    -   **Issue**: Viewer failed to load network images, treating them as local assets.
    -   **Fix**: Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` to use `CustomImage` (which handles both network and asset images) instead of `AssetImage`.
-   **UI Refinements**:
    -   **Rounded Corners (Conditional)**:
        -   **Issue**: Dialog had sharp corners, or `ClipRRect` caused mobile cropping.
        -   **Fix**: Removed `ClipRRect` from `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart`. Applied `ClipRRect` conditionally around the `FullscreenPhotoViewer` within the `Dialog` in `menu_section.dart` and `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` (for large screens only), using `Sizes.p16` for `borderRadius`.
    -   **Image Fit**: Changed `BoxFit.cover` to `BoxFit.contain` for `CustomImage` in `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` to prevent cropping.
    -   **Button Placement & Visibility**:
        -   **Issue**: User disliked `AppBar` on large screens and wanted navigation buttons back.
        -   **Fix**: Made `AppBar` conditional (only on small screens). On large screens, close button is `Positioned` with a background. Re-introduced `Positioned` next/previous navigation buttons for large screens.
        -   **Close Button Position (Small Screen)**: Moved the close button to the top-right corner of the `AppBar` on small screens.

## Chat History - Image Gallery & Review Section Enhancements

This session focused on refining image galleries, fixing navigation issues, and a major overhaul of the review section to support advanced features.

### 1. Image Gallery Arrow Visibility

-   **Goal**: Remove navigation arrows from the main image gallery while retaining them conditionally in the fullscreen viewer.
-   **Implementation**: Modified `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` to remove gallery arrows. `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` already handled conditional arrow visibility.

### 2. Fullscreen Photo Viewer Navigation Fix

-   **Goal**: Correct back button behavior in the fullscreen photo viewer (should return to detail screen, not home screen) while preserving fullscreen dialog animation.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Integrated the photo viewer into `GoRouter` by adding a new top-level named route (`AppRoute.photoViewer`).
    -   Updated `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` and `menu_section.dart` to use `context.pushNamed(AppRoute.photoViewer.name, extra: {...})` for navigation.

### 3. Home Screen "See All" Navigation Fix

-   **Goal**: Ensure navigating from the Home Screen's "Popular" section to the Popular Entities List Screen preserves navigation history.
-   **Implementation**: Modified `popular_entities_section.dart` to change `context.goNamed` to `context.pushNamed` for the "See All" button and individual item taps.

### 4. Review Section Overhaul (Pagination, Filtering, Sorting)

-   **Goal**: Implement server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering for reviews on the "All Reviews" screen, and optimize the review preview on the detail screen.
-   **Key Implementations**:
    -   **Architectural Refinement**: Moved `ReviewSortOption` enum to the domain layer (`review_sorting.dart`) for better separation of concerns.
    -   **Repository Enhancement**:
        -   Added `fetchPaginatedReviews` method to `reviews_repository.dart` to handle server-side sorting (Latest, Oldest, Highest/Lowest Rating) and star-rating filtering, with cursor-based pagination.
        -   Added `fetchReviewsPreviewList` for efficient fetching of the 5 latest reviews for the detail screen preview.
    -   **State Management**: Created `ReviewPaginationState` and `PaginatedReviewsNotifier` to manage the state of the infinite scroll review list.
    -   **UI Refactoring (`ReviewListScreen`)**:
        -   Rewrote `ReviewListScreen` to be a `ConsumerStatefulWidget` using `CustomScrollView` and `Sliver` widgets for full-page scrolling.
        -   Implemented infinite scroll logic with a `ScrollController` and `PaginatedReviewsNotifier`.
        -   Connected filter/sort UI to trigger data refetches via the notifier.
        -   Set "Latest" as the default sort option.
        -   Added "end of reviews" message and retry button for pagination errors.
    -   **Detail Screen Optimization**: Updated `entity_detail_service.dart` to use the new `reviewsPreviewListProvider` for the review preview.
    -   **Fake Repository Implementation**: Implemented `fetchPaginatedReviews` and `fetchReviewsPreviewList` in `fake_reviews_repository.dart`, including tie-breaking logic for cursors using `userId`.
    -   **Debugging & Data Fixes**:
        -   Debugged and resolved review repetition in the fake repository by making `testReviews` data unique (unique `updatedAt` and `userId` combinations).
        -   Debugged and resolved reviews not rendering by adding missing user data to `test_users.dart`.
        -   Debugged and resolved layout issues on `ReviewListScreen` (unbounded height, padding).
    -   **Firebase Indexing**: Informed the user about the potential need for Firebase composite indexes for server-side filtering.

## Chat History - Firestore Indexing and Query Debugging

This session focused on creating and managing Firestore indexes for various repositories to support complex filtering and sorting queries, and debugging a query issue related to missing data fields.

### 1. Firestore Index Generation

-   **Goal**: Automate the creation of Firestore indexes for the application's repositories.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Analyzed the queries in `sub_categories_repository.dart`, `ads_carousel_repository.dart` (including its associated cloud function), `residence_repository.dart`, `food_repository.dart`, and `reviews_repository.dart`.
    -   Determined the required composite indexes for each repository based on their filtering and sorting logic.
    -   Created a `firestore.indexes.json` file to define all the necessary indexes.
    -   Created a default `firestore.rules` file.
    -   Updated `firebase.json` to recognize and deploy the new index and rules files.
-   **Challenges & Solutions**:
    -   The `residence_repository.dart` required a large number (80) of indexes due to its highly flexible filtering options. We discussed the trade-offs of having a large number of indexes.
    -   Experienced difficulties in updating the main `firestore.indexes.json` file directly. To resolve this, a separate `food.json` file was created to provide the user with the JSON for the `food_listings` and `reviews` indexes, which they could then manually merge.

### 2. Food Listing Filtering Bug Fix

-   **Goal**: Fix a bug where food listings with 0 reviews would disappear when sorting by rating.
-   **Investigation**:
    -   Analyzed the Firestore query in `food_repository.dart`, which included `.where('avgRating', isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: 0)`.
    -   The root cause was identified: Firestore's `where` filter excludes documents that do not have the specified field. Items with 0 reviews were missing the `avgRating` field in the database.
-   **Conclusion**: The issue is with the data in Firestore, not the query logic itself. The fix is to ensure that all `food_listings` documents have a default `avgRating` field with a value of `0` upon creation.

### 3. Repository Analysis for Indexing

-   **Goal**: Ensure all repositories that interact with Firestore have the necessary indexes.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Performed a comprehensive search for all repositories in the project.
    -   Analyzed the remaining repositories (`user_repository.dart`, `connectivity_repository.dart`, `auth_repository.dart`, `image_upload_repository.dart`, `food_details_repository.dart`, `residence_details_repository.dart`, `entity_search_repository.dart`, `user_mode_repository.dart`, `geolocator_repository.dart`, `user_location_repository.dart`).
    -   **Conclusion**: Confirmed that no other repositories required composite indexes.

## Chat History - End-to-End Security Hardening

This session was a comprehensive security audit and hardening of the application, focusing on backend rules, secret management, and code verification.

### 1. Cloud Function Security (App Check)

-   **Goal**: Secure Cloud Functions to prevent access from unauthorized clients (e.g., bots, scripts).
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Implemented Firebase App Check for all three Cloud Functions (`getCarouselAds`, `recordAdImpressions`, `recordAdClick`).
    -   Added the `firebase_app_check` dependency to the Flutter project and configured it in `main.dart`.
    -   Modified the Cloud Functions to use the modern `(request)` signature compatible with `firebase-functions` v6+ and to validate the `request.app` token.
    -   Debugged and resolved several TypeScript compilation errors during the deployment process.

### 2. Secure Key Management

-   **Goal**: Ensure the reCAPTCHA v3 site key for the web is stored securely.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Explained that while the site key is public, it is best practice not to hardcode it.
    -   Guided the user to leverage their existing `envied` package to manage the key, which they then implemented.

### 3. Firestore Rules Overhaul

-   **Goal**: Fix critical security vulnerabilities in the database rules.
-   **Investigation**: Read and analyzed `firestore.rules`.
    -   **Identified Critical Issues**: The rules allowed any logged-in user to create or update data that did not belong to them (e.g., creating fake user profiles, creating/updating any review).
    -   **Fix**: Rewrote the rules for the `users`, `reviews`, `residence_listings`, and `food_listings` collections to enforce the principle of least privilege. Users can now only create, update, or delete their own documents.

### 4. Codebase Verification

-   **Goal**: Ensure the application code (repositories) aligns with the new, stricter security rules.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Searched for and identified all non-fake repository classes in the Flutter application.
    -   Reviewed the data access logic in `UserRepository`, `ReviewsRepository`, `FoodRepository`, and `ResidenceRepository`.
    -   **Conclusion**: Confirmed that the client-side code was already well-structured and fully compatible with the secure backend rules, requiring no changes.

### 5. Hardcoded Secret Scan

-   **Goal**: Scan the application for any other hardcoded secrets.
-   **Implementation**: Performed a search for common secret-related keywords in the `lib` directory.
-   **Conclusion**: Found no hardcoded secrets, confirming good security practices.
