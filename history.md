## Chat History - Implementing `isRoomAvailable` Feature

This session focused on implementing the `isRoomAvailable` feature for residences, providing a more relevant availability status than `isOpen`.

### 1. Data Model Updates

- **`Entity` & `EntityDetail`**: Added `isRoomAvailable` (boolean, default `true`) to `Residence` and `ResidenceDetail` models.
- **`ShopForm`**: Added `isRoomAvailable` to the `ShopForm` model, including mapping from `ResidenceDetail` and setting a default value.

### 2. Test Data Update

- **`test_residences.dart`**: Updated test residences to include `isRoomAvailable` with mixed `true` and `false` values for testing.

### 3. UI (Form) Implementation

- **`residence_specific_section.dart`**: Added `isRoomAvailable` and its `onChanged` callback to the widget's constructor.
- **`step_4_screen.dart`**: Updated to pass `isRoomAvailable` and its callback to `ResidenceSpecificSection`.
- **`filter_dialog.dart`**: Updated the `residence` filter section to include a `FilterSwitch` for `isRoomAvailable` and to use the new `showAvailableOnly` localization key.

### 4. UI (Display) Implementation

- **`entity_indicator.dart`**: Added `AvailableIndicator` (green) and `UnavailableIndicator` (red) widgets.
- **`app_en.arb`**: Added `available` and `unavailable` localization keys.
- **`entity_card.dart`**: Modified to display `AvailableIndicator` or `UnavailableIndicator` for `Residence` entities based on `isRoomAvailable`.
- **`home_detail_top_right_section.dart`**: Added `AvailableInfo` widget (similar to `FurnishedInfo`) to display `isRoomAvailable` on the detail page.

### 5. Filtering & Repository Updates

- **`entity_filter.dart`**: Added `isRoomAvailable` to `ResidenceFilter`.
- **`filter_controller.dart`**: Updated to handle `isRoomAvailable` in `updateFilter` and `resetFilters` methods.
- **`fake_residence_repository.dart`**: Updated `_applyResidenceFilter` to filter by `isRoomAvailable`.
- **`real_residence_repository.dart`**: Updated `_buildFilteredQuery` to filter by `isRoomAvailable`.

### 6. Backend Refactoring & Migration Function

- **Cloud Function Refactoring**: Broke down `index.ts` into `config.ts`, `types.ts`, and `core.ts` for better organization.
- **Data Migration Function**: Implemented `migrateResidenceData` (HTTP-triggered) to:
    - Add `isRoomAvailable` to existing `residence_listings` documents.
    - Remove `isOpen` and `scheduledTaskNames` from `residence_listings`.
    - This function was initially in `migrate.ts` but later moved into `index.ts` for deployment troubleshooting, and then removed after use.

### 7. Resolution of Compiler Errors

- Throughout the process, various compiler errors were encountered and systematically addressed due to the introduction of new fields and refactoring.

### Current Status

The `isRoomAvailable` feature is fully implemented for residences, providing a relevant availability status. The Cloud Functions have been refactored, and a data migration function was provided and used to update existing Firestore data.

## Chat History - Cloud Functions Optimization and Cloud Tasks Emulator Troubleshooting

This session focused on optimizing Cloud Functions for cost and troubleshooting issues with the Firebase Cloud Tasks emulator.

### 1. Cloud Functions Optimization

- **Goal:** Reduce unnecessary Cloud Function invocations for `onDocumentWritten` triggers.
- **Implementation:** Modified `app/functions/src/index.ts` to add a check that only proceeds with `updateAndReschedule` if `openingHours` or `entityStatus` fields have changed, or if it's a new document. This prevents the function from running its full logic for irrelevant document updates.
- **Error Resolution:** Addressed a TypeScript compiler error (`Not all code paths return a value.ts(7030)`) by changing `return null;` to `return;` in the early exit condition.
- **Enhanced Error Logging:** Improved error logging in the `setOpenStatus` HTTP function in `app/functions/src/index.ts` to provide more detailed error messages in Cloud Logging for easier debugging.

### 2. Cloud Tasks Emulator Troubleshooting

- **Initial Problem:** "Error: 5 NOT_FOUND: Queue does not exist." when the Cloud Function attempted to schedule a task.
- **Initial Diagnosis:** Suspected `firebase.json` configuration for Cloud Tasks.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    - Identified `QUEUE_NAME` (`place-status-updates`) from `app/functions/src/config.ts`.
    - Attempted to add a `cloud_tasks` section to `app/firebase.json` under `emulators`.
    - Encountered `firebase.json` syntax errors (premature closing brace in `emulators` block).
    - Corrected `firebase.json` syntax.
    - Continued to face "Queue does not exist" error, and the Cloud Tasks emulator showed `n/a` in the UI.
    - **Critical Discovery (via Google Search):** Learned that `firebase.json` does *not* directly define Cloud Tasks queues. Instead, queue configuration is done within the Cloud Functions code (for `functions.tasks.taskQueue` functions), and the Firebase CLI automatically creates them on deployment.
    - **Revised Diagnosis:** The `cloud_tasks` block in `firebase.json` was an "unknown property" because it's not a valid top-level configuration for defining queues. The Cloud Tasks emulator was failing to start because it couldn't determine the project ID, or due to other environmental factors.
    - **Attempted Fix:** Removed the `cloud_tasks` block from `firebase.json`.
    - **Persistent Issue:** The Cloud Tasks emulator continued to fail initialization, even when explicitly started with `--only tasks --project <PROJECT_ID>`. The error message "Emulator UI is not starting... Pass the --project flag to specify a project" persisted, despite the flag being present.
- **Current Status:** The Cloud Tasks emulator is still not initializing correctly, preventing local testing of Cloud Task scheduling. This points to a deeper issue with the Firebase CLI installation or the local environment. Manual troubleshooting steps (updating Firebase CLI, clearing emulator cache, Node.js version check) were recommended for the user to perform.

### Next Steps

- User will manually perform recommended troubleshooting steps for the Firebase CLI and local environment.
- Once the Cloud Tasks emulator is successfully running, testing of Cloud Task scheduling will resume.

## Chat History - Home Feature Enhancements & Bug Fixes

This session focused on several enhancements and bug fixes related to the home feature, including popular entities, pricing, and opening hours logic.

### 1. Popular Entities Critical Error Status

-   **Goal**: Ensure critical errors in fetching popular entities are reported.
-   **Implementation**: Modified `app/lib/src/features/home/presentation/controllers/home_error_controller.dart` to include `popularEntitiesNotifierProvider` in the `criticalErrorStatus` check.

### 2. Pricing Model Integration

-   **Goal**: Integrate a new `Pricing` model for residences to handle cost, unit, and period.
-   **Implementation**: 
    -   Defined `PricingUnit` and `PricingPeriod` enums in `app/lib/src/features/home/domain/pricing.dart`.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/home/domain/entity.dart` to use `Pricing` object for residence pricing.
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/features/home/data/real/residence_repository.dart` to sort by `pricing.cost`.
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/core/constants/test_residences.dart` to use `Pricing` objects and removed duplicate entries.
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/features/home/data/fake/fake_residence_repository.dart` to sort by `pricing.cost`.
    -   Refined `displayLabel` in `app/lib/src/features/home/domain/pricing.dart` to output "per [unit] per [period]" format.
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/features/home/presentation/widgets/entity_card.dart` to correctly display formatted pricing using `currencyFormatterProvider` and `pricing.displayLabel`.

### 3. Currency Formatting (PKR Specific)

-   **Goal**: Configure currency display for Pakistani Rupees (PKR) only.
-   **Implementation**: Modified `app/lib/src/core/utils/currency_formatter.dart` to use `ur_PK` locale, "Rs. " symbol, and `decimalDigits: 0`.

### 4. Entity Field Refactoring (`timezone`, `EntityType`, `isOpen`)

-   **Goal**: Streamline entity fields and shift `isOpen` logic to client-side.
-   **Implementation**: 
    -   Removed `timezone` and `EntityType` from `Residence` and `Food` entities in `app/lib/src/features/home/domain/entity.dart`.
    -   Removed `EntityType` from `app/lib/src/core/constants/test_food_list.dart` and `app/lib/src/core/constants/test_residences.dart`.
    -   Removed `isOpen` filtering logic from `app/lib/src/features/home/data/fake/fake_food_repository.dart` and `app/lib/src/features/home/data/real/food_repository.dart`.
    -   Ensured `isOpen` field remains in `Food` entity for client-side use.

### 5. Opening Hours Logic Refinement & Bug Fixes

-   **Goal**: Correctly determine and display opening status based on `openingHours` data, handling nullable slots and day mapping.
-   **Implementation**: 
    -   Created `app/lib/src/core/utils/opening_hours_checker.dart` for client-side `isOpen` calculation.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/home/presentation/widgets/entity_indicator.dart` to use `OpeningHoursChecker` for `Food` entities.
    -   Removed `isOpen` filter from `app/lib/src/features/home/presentation/widgets/filter_dialog.dart` and `app/lib/src/features/home/domain/entity_filter.dart`.
    -   Corrected `opening_hours_checker.dart` to handle `OpeningHours` model's `isDayOff`, `is24Hours`, and nullable `slots` fields.
    -   Fixed `TimeSlot` field names (`open`, `close` instead of `startTime`, `endTime`) in `opening_hours_checker.dart`.
    -   Corrected `DayOfWeek` mapping in `opening_hours_checker.dart` (`now.weekday % 7`) to align with enum definition.
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/core/common_widgets/opening_hours_widget.dart` and `app/lib/src/features/my_shop/presentation/widgets/opening_hour_tile.dart` to handle nullable `slots` in `OpeningHours` model.
