## Chat History - Home Detail Feature Enhancements & Error Handling

This session focused on refining the `home_detail` feature, implementing robust error handling, and debugging various UI and data fetching issues.

### 1. `EntityDetail` Refactoring & `RatingBreakdown` Conversion

-   **Goal**: Improve code organization and leverage Freezed for data models.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Reordered fields in `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/domain/entity_detail.dart` for better readability and logical grouping.
    -   Converted `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/domain/rating_breakdown.dart` to a Freezed class, removing manual `toJson`, `fromJson`, `==`, and `hashCode` implementations.

### 2. `Pricing` Integration & `ShopForm` Update

-   **Goal**: Integrate the new `Pricing` Freezed class into `Residence` entities and related forms.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/data/fake/test_residence_details.dart` to use the `Pricing` object for residence pricing.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/my_shop/presentation/shop_form_extension.dart` to correctly handle the `Pricing` object when converting `ShopForm` to `ResidenceDetail`.

### 3. Granular Error Handling for Entity Details & Reviews

-   **Goal**: Implement distinct error handling for critical (entity data) and non-critical (reviews data) fetching failures.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Modified `fetchEntityWithReviews` in `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/application/entity_detail_service.dart` to:
        -   Re-throw errors if entity data fetching fails (critical).
        -   Catch errors and set a `reviewsLoadFailed` flag if reviews data fetching fails (non-critical).
    -   Updated `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_screen.dart` to:
        -   Display `EmptyPlaceholderWidget` for critical errors.
        -   Display `PersistentErrorBar` at the bottom for non-critical review loading errors.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_bottom_section.dart` to pass the `reviewsLoadFailed` flag.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/review_section.dart` to hide the entire review section if `reviewsLoadFailed` is true.
    -   Added `reviewsLoadFailedMessage` to `app/lib/src/localization/app_en.arb`.

### 4. Debugging & Testing Enhancements

-   **Goal**: Diagnose and resolve "infinite loading" issues and ensure error handling works as expected.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Identified and corrected a bug in `fetchEntityWithReviews` where `reviewsLoadFailed` was always returned as `true`.
    -   Created `app/lib/src/features/auth/data/test_users.dart` and `app/lib/src/features/auth/data/fake_user_repository.dart` for testing user data fetching.
    -   Modified `app/lib/src/features/auth/data/user_repository.dart` to include both `Stream<AppUser?> getUserById` and `Future<AppUser?> fetchUserById` providers.
    -   Updated `ReviewListTile` to use `fetchUserByIdProvider`.
    -   Set `addDelay: false` for `FakeUserRepository` in `app_bootstrap_fakes.dart` and `app_bootstrap_local.dart` to prevent perceived "infinite loading" from delays in fake data fetching.
    -   Injected and removed temporary exceptions in `fake_reviews_repository.dart` and `fake_residence_details_repository.dart` for testing critical and non-critical error paths.
    -   Confirmed that popular entities were not incorrectly showing in normal entity lists.
