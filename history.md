## Chat History - Home Screen & Home Detail UI Refinements

This session focused on addressing various UI and display issues on the home screen and home detail screen, including filtering, popular indicators, pricing, and dynamic open/closed status.

### 1. Popular Entities Filtering Debugging

-    **Goal**: Investigate why popular entities were appearing in normal entity lists.
-    **Investigation**: Examined `EntitiesNotifier`, `PopularEntitiesNotifier`, `EntityService`, `FakeResidenceRepository`, `FakeFoodRepository`, `test_residences.dart`, and `test_food_list.dart`.
-    **Conclusion**: Determined that the filtering logic and test data were correct, and the issue was a misunderstanding.

### 2. Popular Indicator Refinement

-    **Goal**: Improve the visual display of the "popular" status on the home detail screen.
-    **Implementation**:
    -    Changed the "popular" indicator from a star icon to a flame icon (`Icons.local_fire_department`).
    -    Implemented the flame icon next to the entity's name in both the `AppBar` (`AppBarContent`) and the `HomeDetailTopRightSection` (`ItemTitleSection`).

### 3. Pricing Display Confirmation

-    **Goal**: Confirm the correct display of pricing information on the home detail screen.
-    **Confirmation**: Verified that the `formattedPrice` and `displayLabel` were correctly combined and displayed, and confirmed with the user that the "Starts from" text was not desired.

### 4. Dynamic Open/Closed Status Display

-    **Goal**: Implement a more dynamic and context-aware display for entity open/closed status.
-    **Implementation**:
    -    Modified `OpeningHoursWidget` to dynamically calculate `isOpen` based on `entity.entityStatus` and `OpeningHoursChecker.isOpenNow`.
    -    Refactored `OpeningHoursLabel` to receive the `EntityDetail` object.
    -    Implemented dynamic text for open/closed status in `OpeningHoursLabel`:
        -    For `Food`: "Open" / "Closed" (for both explicit and calculated status).
        -    For `Residence`: "Office Open" / "Office Closed" (for both explicit and calculated status).
    -    Added new localization keys (`officeOpen`, `officeClosed`) to `app/lib/src/localization/app_en.arb`.

### 5. Home Detail Right Section Redesign Attempt

-    **Goal**: Redesign the right section of the home detail screen for a more modern, professional, and user-friendly look.
-    **Attempted Implementation**: Proposed and implemented a refactoring using `Card`s for grouping and new custom widgets (`_PriceAndLocationSection`, `_RatingAndReviewSection`, `_ResidenceSpecificsSection`, `_OpeningHoursSection`, `_ContactOptionsSection`).
-    **Outcome**: The user was dissatisfied with the result and reverted the changes, preferring their own previous design.

## Chat History - Menu Images & Fullscreen Photo Viewer Enhancements

This session focused on enhancing the `HomeDetailScreen` with a new "Menu Images" section for food entities and refining the `FullscreenPhotoViewer`.

### 1. Dynamic Open/Closed Status Display Refinement

-    **Goal**: Hide the opening hours section and its divider if opening hours are null.
-    **Implementation**: Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_top_right_section.dart` to conditionally render `OpeningHoursWidget` and its associated `Divider` based on `entity.openingHours` being null.
This also fixed an inconsistency where non-residence entities lacked a divider.

### 2. Menu Images Section Implementation

-    **Goal**: Add a new section to display menu images for food entities on the `HomeDetailScreen`.
-    **Design Decisions**:
    -    **Placement**: Decided on a full-width section below the main details (`ResponsiveTwoColumnLayout`) and above the reviews (`HomeDetailBottomSection`).
    -    **Aspect Ratio**: Settled on a 3:4 portrait aspect ratio for menu image thumbnails, based on user feedback.
    -    **Height**: Set the horizontal list height to 240px.
    -    **Widget**: Used `ListView.separated` with `CustomImageWrapper` for skeleton loading and better image handling.
-    **Implementation Steps**:
    -    Confirmed `FoodDetail` already had `menuImageUrls`.
    -    Added placeholder `menuImageUrls` to `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/data/fake/test_food_details.dart`.
    -    Created `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/menu_section.dart`.
    -    Added "menu" localization key to `app/lib/src/localization/app_en.arb`.
    -    Integrated `MenuSection` into `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/home_detail_bottom_section.dart`, conditionally showing it for `FoodDetail` with images.

### 3. Fullscreen Photo Viewer Enhancements & Bug Fixes

-    **Goal**: Improve the `FullscreenPhotoViewer`'s functionality and address UI issues.
-    **Bug Fix (Asset vs. Network Image)**:
    -    **Issue**: Viewer failed to load network images, treating them as local assets.
    -    **Fix**: Modified `app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` to use `CustomImage` (which handles both network and asset images) instead of `AssetImage`.
-    **UI Refinements**:
    -    **Rounded Corners (Conditional)**:
        -    **Issue**: Dialog had sharp corners, or `ClipRRect` caused mobile cropping.
        -    **Fix**: Removed `ClipRRect` from `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart`. Applied `ClipRRect` conditionally around the `FullscreenPhotoViewer` within the `Dialog` in `menu_section.dart` and `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` (for large screens only), using `Sizes.p16` for `borderRadius`.
    -    **Image Fit**: Changed `BoxFit.cover` to `BoxFit.contain` for `CustomImage` in `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` to prevent cropping.
    -    **Button Placement & Visibility**:
        -    **Issue**: User disliked `AppBar` on large screens and wanted navigation buttons back.
        -    **Fix**: Made `AppBar` conditional (only on small screens). On large screens, close button is `Positioned` with a background. Re-introduced `Positioned` next/previous navigation buttons for large screens.
        -    **Close Button Position (Small Screen)**: Moved the close button to the top-right corner of the `AppBar` on small screens.

## Chat History - Image Gallery & Review Section Enhancements

This session focused on refining image galleries, fixing navigation issues, and a major overhaul of the review section to support advanced features.

### 1. Image Gallery Arrow Visibility

-    **Goal**: Remove navigation arrows from the main image gallery while retaining them conditionally in the fullscreen viewer.
-    **Implementation**: Modified `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` to remove gallery arrows. `full_screen_photo_viewer.dart` already handled conditional arrow visibility.

### 2. Fullscreen Photo Viewer Navigation Fix

-    **Goal**: Correct back button behavior in the fullscreen photo viewer (should return to detail screen, not home screen) while preserving fullscreen dialog animation.
-    **Implementation**:
    -    Integrated the photo viewer into `GoRouter` by adding a new top-level named route (`AppRoute.photoViewer`).
    -    Updated `home_detail_top_left_section.dart` and `menu_section.dart` to use `context.pushNamed(AppRoute.photoViewer.name, extra: {...})` for navigation.

### 3. Home Screen "See All" Navigation Fix

-    **Goal**: Ensure navigating from the Home Screen's "Popular" section to the Popular Entities List Screen preserves navigation history.
-    **Implementation**: Modified `popular_entities_section.dart` to change `context.goNamed` to `context.pushNamed` for the "See All" button and individual item taps.

### 4. Review Section Overhaul (Pagination, Filtering, Sorting)

-    **Goal**: Implement server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering for reviews on the "All Reviews" screen, and optimize the review preview on the detail screen.
-    **Key Implementations**:
    -    **Architectural Refinement**: Moved `ReviewSortOption` enum to the domain layer (`review_sorting.dart`) for better separation of concerns.
    -    **Repository Enhancement**:
        -    Added `fetchPaginatedReviews` method to `reviews_repository.dart` to handle server-side sorting (Latest, Oldest, Highest/Lowest Rating) and star-rating filtering, with cursor-based pagination.
        -    Added `fetchReviewsPreviewList` for efficient fetching of the 5 latest reviews for the detail screen preview.
    -    **State Management**: Created `ReviewPaginationState` and `PaginatedReviewsNotifier` to manage the state of the infinite scroll review list.
    -    **UI Refactoring (`ReviewListScreen`)**:
        -    Rewrote `ReviewListScreen` to be a `ConsumerStatefulWidget` using `CustomScrollView` and `Sliver` widgets for full-page scrolling.
        -    Implemented infinite scroll logic with a `ScrollController` and `PaginatedReviewsNotifier`.
        -    Connected filter/sort UI to trigger data refetches via the notifier.
        -    Set "Latest" as the default sort option.
        -    Added "end of reviews" message and retry button for pagination errors.
    -    **Detail Screen Optimization**: Updated `entity_detail_service.dart` to use the new `reviewsPreviewListProvider` for the review preview.
    -    **Fake Repository Implementation**: Implemented `fetchPaginatedReviews` and `fetchReviewsPreviewList` in `fake_reviews_repository.dart`, including tie-breaking logic for cursors using `userId`.
    -    **Debugging & Data Fixes**:
        -    Debugged and resolved review repetition in the fake repository by making `testReviews` data unique (unique `updatedAt` and `userId` combinations).
        -    Debugged and resolved reviews not rendering by adding missing user data to `test_users.dart`.
        -    Debugged and resolved layout issues on `ReviewListScreen` (unbounded height, padding).
    -    **Firebase Indexing**: Informed the user about the potential need for Firebase composite indexes for server-side filtering.
