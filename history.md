## Chat History - Implementing Independent Filters for Entity Lists

This session focused on refactoring the filtering mechanism to allow independent filtering for "all entities" and "popular entities" lists, addressing the issue where applying a filter to one list affected the other.

### Problem Identification

The core problem was that both `EntitiesNotifier` (for "all entities") and `PopularEntitiesNotifier` (for "popular entities") were watching the same `filterControllerProvider`. This meant any filter applied via the `FilterDialog` would update this shared provider, causing both lists to react to the same filter criteria.

### Solution - Parameterizing the Filter Provider

Instead of creating separate filter controllers, a more elegant and maintainable solution was adopted: parameterizing the existing `filterControllerProvider` with a `FilterContext` enum.

1.  **`FilterContext` Enum Creation**: A new enum `FilterContext` was introduced with two values: `all` and `popular`. This enum serves to differentiate the context in which a filter is being applied.

2.  **`FilterController` Modification**:
    *   The `filterControllerProvider` was updated to become a `family` provider, accepting both `categoryId` and the new `FilterContext` as parameters. This allows Riverpod to maintain distinct filter states for each combination of category and filter context.
    *   The `build` method of `FilterController` was updated to reflect this new signature.

3.  **Notifier Updates**:
    *   `EntitiesNotifier` was modified to watch and read from `filterControllerProvider` using `FilterContext.all`.
    *   `PopularEntitiesNotifier` was modified to watch and read from `filterControllerProvider` using `FilterContext.popular`.

4.  **UI (`FilterDialog`) Adaptation**:
    *   The `FilterDialog` widget was updated to accept a `FilterContext` parameter.
    *   Inside the dialog, this `FilterContext` is used to correctly read the initial filter state and to apply changes to the specific `filterControllerProvider` instance (either for `all` or `popular` entities).

5.  **Presentation Layer Updates**:
    *   `EntitiesListSection`: The `_showFilterDialog` method was updated to pass `FilterContext.all` when opening the `FilterDialog`.
    *   `PopularEntitiesListScreen`: The `_showFilterDialog` method was updated to pass `FilterContext.popular` when opening the `FilterDialog`. Additionally, the `_onBack` method was updated to reset the `filterControllerProvider` specifically for `FilterContext.popular`.
    *   `PopularEnitiesSection`: The `_onSeeAllPressed` method was updated to reset the `filterControllerProvider` specifically for `FilterContext.popular`.

### Verification

The `filter_controller.g.dart` file was confirmed to have been correctly regenerated by `build_runner`, reflecting the new provider signature. All necessary code modifications across the application, presentation, and data layers have been completed to ensure independent filtering functionality.

## Chat History - Fixing Time Parsing and Filtering Logic

This session focused on two main issues: incorrect open/closed status due to time format parsing and filtering the main entity list to exclude popular items.

### 1. Time Parsing Bug in `isEntityOpen`

*   **Problem:** Entities were showing as "closed" at midday even when their hours were set from 9 AM to 9 PM. This was traced to the `isEntityOpen` method in `entity_extensions.dart`, which only parsed time in a 24-hour (`HH:mm`) format, while the test data likely used a 12-hour AM/PM format.
*   **Solution:** The `isEntityOpen` method was refactored to be more robust. It now attempts to parse time using the 12-hour AM/PM format (`h:mm a`) first. If that fails, it falls back to trying the 24-hour format. This ensures both formats are handled correctly. The method was also streamlined to remove duplicated code between `Food` and `Residence` entity types.

### 2. Filtering Non-Popular Entities

*   **Requirement:** The main entities list (the "All" section) needed to be modified to only show items that are *not* marked as popular (`isPopular: false`).
*   **Solution:** The data fetching methods in both the real and fake repositories were updated.
    *   **Real Repositories (`.../data/real/`):** In `food_repository.dart` and `residence_repository.dart`, a `.where('isPopular', isEqualTo: false)` clause was added to the Firestore queries within the `fetch...List` and `fetch...ListBySubCategoryId` methods.
    *   **Fake Repositories (`.../data/fake/`):** In `fake_food_repository.dart` and `fake_residence_repository.dart`, a `.where((e) => e.isPopular == false)` filter was added to the in-memory lists before any other filters were applied.

This ensures that the "Popular" section and the "All" section now show mutually exclusive sets of items.
