## Chat History - Implementing Independent Filters for Entity Lists

This session focused on refactoring the filtering mechanism to allow independent filtering for "all entities" and "popular entities" lists, addressing the issue where applying a filter to one list affected the other.

### Problem Identification

The core problem was that both `EntitiesNotifier` (for "all entities") and `PopularEntitiesNotifier` (for "popular entities") were watching the same `filterControllerProvider`. This meant any filter applied via the `FilterDialog` would update this shared provider, causing both lists to react to the same filter criteria.

### Solution - Parameterizing the Filter Provider

Instead of creating separate filter controllers, a more elegant and maintainable solution was adopted: parameterizing the existing `filterControllerProvider` with a `FilterContext` enum.

1.  **`FilterContext` Enum Creation**: A new enum `FilterContext` was introduced with two values: `all` and `popular`. This enum serves to differentiate the context in which a filter is being applied.

2.  **`FilterController` Modification**:
    *   The `filterControllerProvider` was updated to become a `family` provider, accepting both `categoryId` and the new `FilterContext` as parameters. This allows Riverpod to maintain distinct filter states for each combination of category and filter context.
    *   The `build` method of `FilterController` was updated to reflect this new signature.

3.  **Notifier Updates**:
    *   `EntitiesNotifier` was modified to watch and read from `filterControllerProvider` using `FilterContext.all`.
    *   `PopularEntitiesNotifier` was modified to watch and read from `filterControllerProvider` using `FilterContext.popular`.

4.  **UI (`FilterDialog`) Adaptation**:
    *   The `FilterDialog` widget was updated to accept a `FilterContext` parameter.
    *   Inside the dialog, this `FilterContext` is used to correctly read the initial filter state and to apply changes to the specific `filterControllerProvider` instance (either for `all` or `popular` entities).

5.  **Presentation Layer Updates**:
    *   `EntitiesListSection`: The `_showFilterDialog` method was updated to pass `FilterContext.all` when opening the `FilterDialog`.
    *   `PopularEntitiesListScreen`: The `_showFilterDialog` method was updated to pass `FilterContext.popular` when opening the `FilterDialog`. Additionally, the `_onBack` method was updated to reset the `filterControllerProvider` specifically for `FilterContext.popular`.
    *   `PopularEnitiesSection`: The `_onSeeAllPressed` method was updated to reset the `filterControllerProvider` specifically for `FilterContext.popular`.

### Verification

The `filter_controller.g.dart` file was confirmed to have been correctly regenerated by `build_runner`, reflecting the new provider signature. All necessary code modifications across the application, presentation, and data layers have been completed to ensure independent filtering functionality.
