Guide: Building a Future Advertiser Dashboard 

  The ad system we've built is not only efficient for displaying ads to users but is also perfectly 
  set up to be the foundation for a powerful dashboard for your advertisers. Hereâ€™s how it all works
  and how you would build it.

  1. How Your Current System is Ready for a Dashboard

  The key is the data model we designed for each ad in the Firestore carousel_ads collection. Think of
  each ad document as a complete summary file.

  Your AdData model already contains the most important fields you need:
   * businessId: The ID of the business that owns the ad. This is the crucial link for showing an    
     advertiser only their own ads.
   * impressionCount: The total number of times the ad has been shown to users.
   * clickCount: The total number of times users have clicked on the ad.
   * status: Shows whether the ad is 'approved', 'pending', 'paused', etc.
   * Other details like imageUrl, startDate, endDate, etc.

  Because we are updating impressionCount and clickCount on the server with our Cloud Functions, this
  data is a reliable and secure source of truth.

  2. How to Implement the Dashboard

  Imagine you are building a new "My Ads" screen in the app for business owners.

   1. Authentication is Key: The business owner would already be logged into your app via Firebase     
      Authentication. Their user profile would contain their unique businessId.

   2. Fetch the Data: To get the data for the dashboard, you would query your Firestore collection like
      this:
       * "Get all documents from the carousel_ads collection where the `businessId` field matches the  
         currently logged-in user's `businessId`."

   3. Display the Metrics: For each ad you fetch, you can now easily create a summary card in the UI that 
      displays:
       * The ad image (imageUrl).
       * The status (status).
       * Total Impressions (impressionCount).
       * Total Clicks (clickCount).
       * Click-Through Rate (CTR): You can calculate this on the fly in the app: (clicks / impressions) * 
         100. This is one of the most important metrics for advertisers.

   4. Enable Real-Time Updates: The best part is that you can make this dashboard live. By using a    
      Firestore snapshots() stream instead of a one-time get() call, your dashboard will automatically
      update in real-time whenever an impression or click is recorded.

  3. Future Enhancement: Daily & Weekly Stats

  Right now, we store the total number of clicks and impressions. Most advertisers will want to see
  "How did my ad do this week?"

  To enable this, you would make a small change to the recordAdImpressions and recordAdClick Cloud 
  Functions.

   * The Idea: Every time a click or impression happens, in addition to incrementing the total count,  
     you would also write a tiny new document into a subcollection.
   * Example: Inside the ad document ad_123, you could create a subcollection named click_events. Every
     time a user clicks the ad, you add a new document to that subcollection with nothing but a        
     timestamp.

   1     carousel_ads/ad_123/click_events/
   2         - { timestamp: 2025-08-26T10:00:00Z }
   3         - { timestamp: 2025-08-26T10:05:12Z }
   4         - { timestamp: 2025-08-27T11:20:00Z }
   * How the Dashboard Uses It: To get the number of clicks "in the last 7 days," your query would be:
     "In the click_events subcollection for this ad, count all documents where the timestamp is within
     the last 7 days."
