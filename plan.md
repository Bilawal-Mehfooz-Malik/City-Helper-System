# Plan to Fix Redirection Issue

1.  **Analyze the routing logic:** Review `app/lib/src/routers/app_router.dart` and `app/lib/src/routers/redirection.dart` to understand the current navigation and redirection implementation.

2.  **Identify the root cause:** The problem lies in `app/lib/src/features/startup/presentation/pick_location_screen.dart`. The `_saveLocation` method incorrectly navigates to `AppRoute.getStarted.name` using `context.goNamed()`. This action pushes the startup screen back onto the navigation stack, allowing the user to go back to it.

3.  **Propose a solution:** Modify the `_saveLocation` method in `pick_location_screen.dart` to navigate to the main application screen instead of the startup screen. The correct destination is `AppRoute.category.name`, which corresponds to the root path `/`. This change will ensure that the startup flow is properly exited and removed from the navigation history.

4.  **Implement the fix:** Apply the proposed change to the `pick_location_screen.dart` file.

5.  **Verification:** After the fix is implemented, the redirection should work as expected. When a user picks a location, they will be taken to the main app screen, and they will not be able to navigate back to the location picking or startup screens.
