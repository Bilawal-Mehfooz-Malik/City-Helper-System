## Codebase Information

The project is a Flutter application designed for city navigation and providing local information services. Here's a summary of its technical stack and architecture:

- **State Management:** Uses `flutter_riverpod` for robust and scalable state management.
- **Navigation:** Implements `go_router` for declarative routing.
- **Backend:** Leverages Firebase for services like Firestore, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Authentication.
- **Architecture:** The codebase is well-structured, following a clean architecture pattern with a clear separation of concerns into `data`, `domain`, `application`, and `presentation` layers.
- **UI:** The user interface is built with Flutter's Material Design widgets and is composed of several reusable components.
- **Code Generation:** The project relies on code generation for tasks such as dependency injection (`riverpod_generator`), serialization (`json_serializable`), and environment variable management (`envied`).

## Changes Made

- **`app/lib/src/routers/app_router.dart`**:
    - Commented out imports related to `homeDetail`, `popular`, `popularDetail`, `leaveReview`, `auth`, `profile`, `account`, `myShop`, and `shopForm`.
    - Commented out the corresponding `AppRoute` enum entries for these features.
    - Commented out the `GoRoute` definitions for these features.
    - Commented out the redirection logic and auth state listener.

- **`app/lib/src/features/home_detail` directory**:
    - Commented out the entire content of all non-generated `.dart` files (excluding `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` files) by wrapping them in `/* ... */` multi-line comments. This includes files in `application`, `data`, `domain`, `presentation`, `presentation/controllers`, `presentation/skeletons`, and `presentation/widgets` subdirectories.

- **`app/lib/src/features/my_shop` directory**:
    - Commented out the entire content of all non-generated `.dart` files (excluding `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` files) by wrapping them in `/* ... */` multi-line comments. This includes files in `application`, `data`, `domain`, `presentation`, `presentation/controllers`, `presentation/screens`, and `presentation/widgets` subdirectories.

- **`app/lib/src/features/review` directory**:
    - Commented out the entire content of all non-generated `.dart` files (excluding `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` files) by wrapping them in `/* ... */` multi-line comments. This includes files in `application`, `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` subdirectories.

- **`app/test/src/features/home_detail` directory**:
    - Commented out the entire content of `fake_food_details_repository_test.dart` and `fake_residence_details_repository_test.dart`.

- **`app/test/src/features/my_shop` and `app/test/src/features/review` directories**:
    - No test files were found for these features, so no changes were made.

- **`app/lib/src/routers/redirection.dart`**:
    - Commented out the authentication and user mode-related logic in `Step 3: Handle Auth State` and `Step 4: Onboarding Block`.

- **`app/lib/src/features/home_detail/presentation/widgets/profile_circular_avator.dart`**:
    - Commented out the `switch_mode` logic and the corresponding `PopupMenuItem`.
    - Commented out `profileData` and `isAdminMode` watches, and the `account` case in `onSelected` switch.
    - **Manual Changes**: Further commented out `_LoggedInAvatar` and `_LoggedOutAvatar` classes, and simplified `ProfileCircularAvatar` to always return a basic avatar.
