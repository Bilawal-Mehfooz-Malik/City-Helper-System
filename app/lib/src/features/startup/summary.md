# Summary of Work on the Startup Feature

This document summarizes the development and testing efforts undertaken for the `startup` feature within the application.

## 1. Initial Codebase Understanding

We began by thoroughly exploring the existing `startup` feature, identifying its architecture, key components, and dependencies. This involved examining:
- The directory structure (`data`, `domain`, `presentation`).
- The `UserLocationRepository` and `GeoLocatorRepository` for data persistence and location services interaction.
- The `StartupScreen` and `PickLocationScreen` for UI and responsive design.
- The `UserLocationController` and `LocalUserLocationSaver` for state management.

## 2. Golden Testing

Golden tests were implemented to ensure the visual consistency and responsiveness of key screens within the startup flow.
- **`StartupScreen`**: Golden tests were created for both mobile and desktop layouts to capture its initial appearance and the state after interacting with the location prompt. Challenges related to `WidgetTester` pumping and `AlertDialog` rendering were addressed.
- **`CategoriesListScreen`**: Golden tests were also set up for this screen to ensure its visual integrity.
- **Key Learnings**: We refined our understanding of `WidgetTester`'s `pump` and `pumpAndSettle` methods, and how to correctly assert for `AlertDialog`s in golden tests. We also learned that `setSurfaceSize` can cause rendering issues in integration tests, leading to a decision to separate visual testing (golden tests) from functional testing (integration tests).

## 3. Integration Testing Journey

The primary goal was to create robust integration tests for the startup flow, ensuring functional correctness and interaction between components, while avoiding platform-specific rendering issues.

### Challenges Encountered & Solutions:

-   **"White Screen" Issue**: Initially, explicit `tester.view.physicalSize` settings in `robot.dart` caused blank screens during integration test runs.
    -   **Solution**: We decided to remove explicit screen size manipulation from integration tests, relying on the test environment's default size. This allowed golden tests to handle visual responsiveness.
-   **`ProviderContainer` Overrides Precedence**: Test-specific `ProviderContainer` overrides were not taking precedence over default fakes defined in `app_bootstrap_fakes.dart`.
    -   **Solution**: Modified `app_bootstrap_fakes.dart` to ensure `...overrides` are placed at the end of the `overrides` list, guaranteeing test-specific configurations are applied.
-   **`FakeGeoLocatorRepository` Exception Handling**: The fake repository was not correctly throwing exceptions (e.g., `LocationServicesDisabledException`) because a `LatLng` was always being returned.
    -   **Solution**: Restructured `FakeGeoLocatorRepository.getCurrentLocation()` to ensure exceptions are thrown and no `LatLng` is returned when an error condition is met.
-   **Asynchronous State Detection in Tests**: Tests failed to reliably detect `AsyncError` states in `UserLocationControllerProvider`, leading to dialogs not being found.
    -   **Solution**: Implemented a robust waiting mechanism using `Future.doWhile` with `tester.pumpAndSettle()` inside the loop. This ensures the test waits for the `AsyncError` state to propagate before asserting UI changes. The dialog is then found using `find.byKey(kDialogDefaultKey)`.

### Implemented Integration Tests:

-   **Happy Path (Desktop Flow)**: Verified the successful user journey of setting the current location and navigating to the `CategoriesListScreen`.
-   **Error Handling (Desktop Flow)**:
    -   **Location Services Disabled**: Tested the scenario where location services are disabled, asserting that the correct `AlertDialog` is displayed.
    -   **Location Permission Denied**: Tested the scenario where location permission is denied, asserting that the correct `AlertDialog` is displayed.

## 4. Web Platform Location Re-prompting (Partial Implementation)

An attempt was made to implement a feature where, on the web platform, if location permission is denied, the user can click a button in the error dialog to re-prompt for permission.
-   **Changes**: Modified `async_value_ui.dart` to include an `onPermissionDeniedRetry` callback for `LocationPermissionDeniedException` and `get_location_content.dart` to provide this callback.
-   **Current Status**: This feature is currently not fully functional and requires further debugging, as indicated by the "only one button OK" issue on web. Debugging steps involved adding `debugPrint` statements to trace execution flow.

## 5. Test Cleanup

-   Removed `app/integration_test/plan.md` and `app/integration_test/startup_integration_test_plan.md` to keep the project clean and organized.

## Conclusion

The `startup` feature has undergone significant development and testing. We have established a solid foundation for golden and integration tests, addressing several complex asynchronous and rendering challenges. The feature's core functionality and error handling are now well-covered by automated tests, providing increased confidence in its reliability. The web re-prompting functionality is a pending item for future refinement.
